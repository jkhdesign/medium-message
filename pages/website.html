  <p>For the past handful of years, I&rsquo;ve been teaching courses about interactive design and the internet.</p>

  <p>I teach within art departments at universities, so we learn about the internet&rsquo;s impact on art&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;and how technological advance often coincides with artistic development.</p>

  <p>In class, we make websites. To do this, we learn the elemental markup and code languages of the web&mdash;HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.</p>

  <p>However, sometimes after the semester is over, I receive perplexing emails from students asking, &ldquo;So how do I actually make a website?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This sparked my own questioning. &ldquo;What is a website, anyway?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s easy to forget. Today there are millions of ways to make a website, and the abundance is daunting. But at its core, a website is still the same as ever before:</p>

  <p>A website is a file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere. A server is a computer that&rsquo;s always connected to the internet, so that when someone types your URL in, the server will offer up your website. Usually you have to pay for a server. You also have to pay for a domain name, which is an understandable piece of language that points to an IP. An IP is a string of numbers that is an address to your server.</p>

  <p>Links (rendered default blue and underlined&mdash;they&rsquo;re the hypertext &ldquo;HT&rdquo; in HTML) are the oxygen of the web. Not all websites have links, but all links connect to other webpages, within the same site or elsewhere.</p>

  <p>But my students already know this! So when they ask me about actually making a website, they are referring to a website in the world &#8230; today.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s healthy to acknowledge today&rsquo;s web is much different than the web many of us grew up using. So when they ask how to make a website (despite having already &ldquo;learned&rdquo;), they are alluding to the technological friction and social pressures that often come along with creating and maintaining a website in 2018.</p>
