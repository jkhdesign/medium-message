    <h1>The Medium is the Message?</h1>
    <p>Content is digested in many different ways, largely as a result of the form that it is presented in. This  microsite is an experiment of this concept, an exploration of how we read what we read. By investigating five different "content-heavy" channels and abstracting them to their most crucial elements, differences and simularities between each  begin to reveal themselves. Scroll down to read five texts that discuss their corrosponding medium by challenging its form.</p>

      <p class="title">My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?<br>

      <p class="caption">Here's a caption for this image. Here's some other stuff. More stuff.</p>

      <p>For the past handful of years, I&rsquo;ve been teaching courses about interactive design and the internet.</p>

      <p>I teach within art departments at universities, so we learn about the internet&rsquo;s impact on art&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;and how technological advance often coincides with artistic development.</p>

      <p>In class, we make websites. To do this, we learn the elemental markup and code languages of the web&mdash;HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.</p>

      <p>However, sometimes after the semester is over, I receive perplexing emails from students asking, &ldquo;So how do I actually make a website?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>This sparked my own questioning. &ldquo;What is a website, anyway?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s easy to forget. Today there are millions of ways to make a website, and the abundance is daunting. But at its core, a website is still the same as ever before:</p>

      <p>A website is a file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere. A server is a computer that&rsquo;s always connected to the internet, so that when someone types your URL in, the server will offer up your website. Usually you have to pay for a server. You also have to pay for a domain name, which is an understandable piece of language that points to an IP. An IP is a string of numbers that is an address to your server.</p>

      <p>Links (rendered default blue and underlined&mdash;they&rsquo;re the hypertext &ldquo;HT&rdquo; in HTML) are the oxygen of the web. Not all websites have links, but all links connect to other webpages, within the same site or elsewhere.</p>

      <p>But my students already know this! So when they ask me about actually making a website, they are referring to a website in the world &#8230; today.</p>

      <p>It&rsquo;s healthy to acknowledge today&rsquo;s web is much different than the web many of us grew up using. So when they ask how to make a website (despite having already &ldquo;learned&rdquo;), they are alluding to the technological friction and social pressures that often come along with creating and maintaining a website in 2018.</p>
